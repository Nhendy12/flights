## General Info 📝
For simplicity, both the backend and front end will be contained in the same GitHub. If this were a larger project I would most definitely separate the Front and Backend.\
Time Spent:
* Design Doc/Planning: 1 hour
* Messing Google Cloud Billing/Troubleshooting to get Google Maps working : 1.5 hours
* Frontend: 3.5 hours
* Backend: 2 hours
* README: .75 hours

* TOTAL: 8.75 hours

## Final Thoughts/Things to share with Client 🔔

* Add clustering of points so the map isn't messy when there is a ton of airports
* Ask for exact colors rgb's (I tried to match it as close as I could)
* Possibly move to csv parser to a worker if files are too big. I would ask the client for expected file sizes
* There is no error handling if uploaded csv is not the expected format
